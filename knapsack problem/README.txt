discrete knapsack problem solved to encrypt and decrypt messages with different keys

This alghorithm in python is probably useless, because of python integer data type. Despite supporting BigIntegers, 
it makes the program encrypt and decrypt messages using 1024bit blocks of private or public key in way too much time. 
Using smaller numbers in keys however makes the code relatively easy to break. Therefore the program is not suitable for use other than
demonstrative purpose.
